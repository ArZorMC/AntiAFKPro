# AntiAFKPro
Detects AFK players in Minecraft very accurately and counts Players Time. System administrators are able to setup actions that are performed on players when they are AFK for a certain amount of time.
This project is the first time using Googles Guice injector, which is a way to globally instatiate objects across classes
